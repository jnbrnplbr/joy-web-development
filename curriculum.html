This course is ideal for individuals who are interested in pursuing a career in visual communication, digital media, or entertainment industries.</p>
<p>Throughout this course, students will develop a strong foundation in both graphic design and animation, learning how to effectively convey messages and create visually compelling content. The course will cover essential topics such as typography, color theory, layout design, illustration, motion graphics, and 2D animation techniques.</p>
<p>By combining theoretical knowledge with practical hands-on projects, students will acquire the necessary skills to conceptualize, design, and animate graphics for various media platforms including print, web, mobile applications, and video. They will learn how to use industry-standard software tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Animate, gaining proficiency in their application to create stunning visual designs and animations.</p>

<h3>COURSE GOAL</h3>

<p>At the end of the course, learners will be able to:</p>
<p>1. Develop a strong foundation in design principles: The course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of fundamental design principles such as color theory, composition, typography, and layout. By mastering these principles, students will be able to create visually appealing and effective designs.</p>
<p>2. Enhance technical skills in graphic design software: The course focuses on developing proficiency in industry-standard graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Students will learn various tools and techniques to manipulate images, create vector graphics, and design layouts for print and digital media.</p>
<p>3. Explore the principles of animation: The course introduces students to the principles of animation, including timing, spacing, squash and stretch, anticipation, and follow-through. Students will learn how to bring static designs to life through motion and create engaging animations.</p>
